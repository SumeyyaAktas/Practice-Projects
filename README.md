<p>These projects aren't necessarily tutorial-based, aren't commented, and only used for my own learning journey. I thought implementing vital functions and concepts used in systems programming might help me deep dive into how things work under the hood. Whenever I am starting up a new project, I also wish to be intentional and purposeful with each line of code I write, which is why implementing things from scratch, or reinventing the wheel, has always been a helpful approach for me.</p>
