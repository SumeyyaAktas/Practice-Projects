These projects aren't tutorial-based, not commented, and only used for my own learning journey. Throughout this practice, I used resources like Beej's Guide to C Programming and Modern C by Jens Gustedt to hone my C language skills. As for figuring out how to write out the functions, I used [The Open Group Base Specifications Issue 8](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/) and [Linux man pages](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/index.html).
